# Open Kennis

Open Kennis is a public learning space.

It is not a place where I explain how things work.
It is a place where I try things, get them wrong, revisit them, and understand them better over time.

If you learn something along the way, that’s a bonus.
If not, it still served its purpose.

## What this is

Open Kennis exists to make learning visible.

I use it to:
- explore ideas that I find interesting
- experiment with concepts, systems, and tools
- write things down to understand them better
- keep track of what I’ve tried, where I got stuck, and what clicked later

Sometimes the notes are rough.
Sometimes they’re incomplete.
Sometimes they’re just wrong.

That’s intentional.

## What this is not

- A tutorial site  
- A reference manual  
- A collection of “best practices”  
- A place to present finished knowledge  

Everything here is a snapshot of understanding at a specific moment.

## Topics

There is no fixed scope.

Topics may include (but are not limited to):
- structured and semantic data
- web technologies and systems
- networking and infrastructure concepts
- experiments that benefit from being written down
- ideas that don’t yet fully make sense

If something feels interesting enough to explore, it belongs here.

## Origin

This website started as part of the *Personal Development Plan* course at Odisee,
but it is intentionally kept independent of that context.

Open Kennis is meant to grow, change, and remain open-ended.

## Language

Most content is written in Dutch.
Some parts may be in English, depending on context.

## Status

Always unfinished.
Always revisitable.

If you ended up understanding something here:
nice.

If not:
at least I did.
